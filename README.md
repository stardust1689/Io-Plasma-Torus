# Io-Plasma-Torus
First real project in Python

- Generates a 3D plot of the planet Jupiter's torus of plasma created by volcanic eruptions of the moon Io.
- Plasma density governed by Jupiter's magnetic field.
- Denisty plot is a Gaussian Curve which drops in proportion to the distance from Jupiter's magnetic equator in reference to magnetic arc length.
- Project created as an undergraduate research assitant for space physics at University of Alaska Fairbanks.
- Project uses numpy, matplotlib, and RK4 routines to create field lines and plasma density lines.
- Many concept for this project were learned "on-the-fly", often through platforms such as StackExchange or official and unofficial documentation
- Initial data supplied by a UAF graduate student's data, whose data was supplied by flybys from NASA space probes.
